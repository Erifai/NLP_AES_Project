data driven features:
lang specific: word, character ngrams, pos, dependency ngrams, word, char, pos embeddings. How dep embeddings?
works across langs: pos, dependency ngrams; pos/dep embeddings

Domain features:
works across langs: num. words, mean sentence length, type token ratio
lexical density, lexical variation etc (Lu-2010 paper), num.errors, num.spelling errors.
individual error rules from language tool

Czech does not have a spell checker I know of. So, error features don't exist for that.
